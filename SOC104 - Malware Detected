# Conclusion

## What We Know:

1. **Has a malicious attack been carried out on the main page of the web application?** The activity appears suspicious and may have the potential for malicious intent. It is recommended to escalate the matter to a tier 2 analyst for further investigation. Meanwhile, precautions should be taken, including isolating the host.
2. **The requests came from which IP address: ...** 172.16.17.8
3. **How has the attack been executed?Explain...**  RUNDLL32.EXE is typically used to execute functions in DLL files, not to open other types of files. This behavior could indicate an attempt to hide malicious code within the GoogleUpdate.bin file. 

In summary, this analysis reveals the execution of processes and the modification of a registry key. The utilization of `RUNDLL32.EXE` to open a file and the deployment of multiple instances of `NOTEPAD.EXE` to open different files are the most intriguing and potentially suspicious aspects of this analysis. A thorough investigation by a malware analyst is recommended to examine the contents of the `GoogleUpdate.bin` files and understand the purpose behind the registry key modification, with the aim of uncovering any potential malicious activities.
