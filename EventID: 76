**Analysis via Crowd-Sourced AI (Virustotal):**

According to Virustotal's Crowd-Sourced AI, the examined file displays Code Insight with notable suspicious behavior. Specifically, the macro named "AutoOpen" within the "NewMacros.bas" module is flagged for its activities.

**Behavioral Analysis:**
- The "AutoOpen" subroutine, set to automatically execute upon document opening, raises concerns due to its actions.
- The macro utilizes the Shell function to run a PowerShell command that initiates the download of a file from a specified URL ('https://filetransfer.io/data-package/UR2whuBv/download').
- The downloaded file is subsequently invoked, introducing the potential for executing arbitrary code or deploying malicious payloads.

**Malicious Indicators:**
- Hispasec identifies this file as malicious, supporting the conclusion that the macro code is indeed harmful.
- The PowerShell command within the "AutoOpen" subroutine, while obfuscated, reveals actions consistent with the creation of a new .NET WebClient object. This object, in turn, utilizes the DownloadString method to fetch and execute a file from the provided URL.

**Signs of Malicious Behavior:**
- Automatic execution upon document opening is a common tactic employed by malware to initiate malicious activities without user interaction.
- Downloading and executing files from the internet, as demonstrated by the PowerShell command, is a suspicious behavior associated with malware and macro viruses.
- The use of obfuscation in the PowerShell command further raises red flags, indicating an attempt to conceal the true purpose of the code and evade detection by security software.

**Conclusion:**
The analyzed macro exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior, including automatic execution, internet-based file retrieval, and code obfuscation. These elements collectively suggest a potential threat, possibly involving the execution of malicious payloads such as ransomware, spyware, or trojans.
